# Tripo: Rig Check

This node sends the ID of a completed Tripo 3D model task to the Tripo API and checks whether that model can be rigged. It waits for the check to finish and then returns a yes/no result plus the skeleton type Tripo recommends for the model.

<Note>
Tripo keeps task records on its servers for 7 days (effective December 1, 2026). A task ID older than that can no longer be resolved, so rerunning a saved workflow after the window fails at this node. To continue, run the earlier Tripo node again to create a fresh task ID, or re-import the model you already downloaded with **Tripo: Import Model**.
</Note>
