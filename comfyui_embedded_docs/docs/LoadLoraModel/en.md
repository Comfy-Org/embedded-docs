# Load LoRA (Model)

Apply a stack of LoRAs to a diffusion model in a single node. Each row of `loras` holds a LoRA file, its strength and an on/off switch, and the rows are applied from top to bottom so every row patches the result of the row above it. Use this node instead of chaining several single LoRA loaders when a workflow applies a long list of LoRAs to the same model.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Description | Data Type | Required | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | The diffusion model the LoRAs will be applied to. | MODEL | Yes | - |
| `loras` | Growable group of LoRAs, applied to the model in row order (`loras.0`, `loras.1`, and so on). Add one row per LoRA; each row holds a file, a strength and an on/off switch. | DYNAMIC_GROUP | Yes | 1 to 20 rows |

### `loras` Row Fields

Every row repeats the following fields, and each field is required within a submitted row.

| Parameter | Description | Data Type | Required | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lora_name` | The name of the LoRA file to apply. | COMBO | Yes | Multiple options available |
| `strength` | How strongly to apply this LoRA. `0` turns it off, and a negative value inverts the effect. (default: 1.0) | FLOAT | Yes | -100 to 100 (step 0.01) |
| `enabled` | Turn off to skip this LoRA without changing its file or strength. (default: true) | BOOLEAN | Yes | false / true |

### Parameter Constraints

- **Row count:** at least one row must be submitted and at most 20 rows are accepted, so the highest row index is 19.
- **Skipped rows:** a row is skipped when its file is empty, when `enabled` is off, or when `strength` is `0`. A negative strength is passed through rather than skipped.
- **Row order:** rows are applied in the order they appear, and each row starts from the model returned by the previous row.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Description | Data Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MODEL` | The diffusion model after the LoRA rows that are not skipped have been applied. | MODEL |
