# Vidu Q4 Reference-to-Video Generation

Generate a video from reference images, optional reference audio, and a prompt with a Vidu Q4 model. This is the reference-to-video variant of the Vidu Q4 generation nodes.

Selecting a `model` reveals the parameters specific to that model.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Description | Data Type | Required | Range |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| `model` | Model to use for video generation. Selecting a model reveals the parameters specific to it: `reference_images`, `reference_audios`, `prompt`, `aspect_ratio`, `resolution`, `duration`, `audio`, and `seed`. | DYNAMIC_COMBO | Yes | `"Vidu Q4 Preview"` |
| `reference_images` | Growable slot: connect one or more reference images (`image_1`, `image_2`, ...) for the generated video; every image of a batch counts toward the total. Refer to them in the prompt by order: image 1, image 2, and so on. | IMAGE | Yes | Up to 15 images |
| `reference_audios` | Growable slot: connect optional voice references (`audio_1`, `audio_2`, `audio_3`), 3 to 12 seconds each. Only the voice is used, not the words: write the dialogue in the prompt and assign a voice by order, for example `image 1 says "Hello!" in the voice from audio 1`. Requires `audio` to be enabled. | AUDIO | No | Up to 3 clips |
| `prompt` | A textual description for video generation, up to 5000 characters. Needed to describe the references you want to use. | STRING | Yes | Any text |
| `aspect_ratio` | The aspect ratio of the output video. | COMBO | Yes | `"16:9"`<br>`"9:16"`<br>`"1:1"`<br>`"3:4"`<br>`"4:3"` |
| `resolution` | Resolution of the output video (default: `"720p"`). | COMBO | Yes | `"540p"`<br>`"720p"`<br>`"1080p"`<br>`"2K"`<br>`"4K"` |
| `duration` | Duration of the output video in seconds (default: 5). | INT | Yes | 3 to 16 |
| `audio` | When enabled, outputs video with sound, including dialogue and sound effects (default: True). | BOOLEAN | Yes | `True`<br>`False` |
| `seed` | Seed controls whether the node should re-run; results are non-deterministic regardless of seed. This parameter has "control after generate" functionality (default: 42). | INT | Yes | 1 to 2147483647 |

**Note:** At most 15 reference images can be used in total, counting every image of a batch. Each image must be at least 128x128 pixels with an aspect ratio between 1:5 and 5:1. Reference audio requires `audio` to be enabled and raising an error otherwise.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Description | Data Type |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| `VIDEO` | The generated video file. | VIDEO |
