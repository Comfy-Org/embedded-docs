# Kling Virtual Try-On

Dress a person in a clothing item with Kling's virtual try-on. Connect a photo of a person and a photo of the garment, and the node returns a new image of that person wearing the item.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Description | Data Type | Required | Range |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| `person_image` | Photo of one person, ideally front-facing or three-quarter view. Images with a side over 2048 pixels are downscaled first. | IMAGE | Yes | N/A |
| `garment_image` | The clothing to put on: product photo, flat lay, mannequin, or on-model photo. An on-model photo can carry over the rest of that outfit. Clothing only; shoes, bags, and accessories are not supported. | IMAGE | Yes | N/A |
| `keep_pose` | Turn off to allow the pose to change for a better outfit presentation. Advanced parameter (default: True). | BOOLEAN | Yes | `True`<br>`False` |
| `seed` | Seed controls whether the node should re-run; results are non-deterministic regardless of seed. This parameter has "control after generate" functionality (default: 42). | INT | Yes | 0 to 2147483647 |

**Note:** The result has the same size as the `person_image`, capped at 2048 pixels on the longest side. Both inputs are uploaded to Kling's API, which may take a moment.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Description | Data Type |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| `IMAGE` | The person wearing the clothing item. | IMAGE |
