# Split Image Channels

Splits an image into its red, green, and blue channels, and returns the alpha channel as a mask. Each color output is a three-channel grayscale image, so it previews and saves like a normal image. Use it to inspect or edit a single channel, or to pull transparency out of an image that carries an alpha channel: images loaded with Load Image have none, since its alpha is exposed as a separate `MASK` output.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Description | Data Type | Required | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `image` | The image to split. A single-channel (grayscale) input is expanded so all three color outputs carry the same data. | IMAGE | Yes | - |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Description | Data Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `red` | The red channel, as a three-channel grayscale image. | IMAGE |
| `green` | The green channel, as a three-channel grayscale image. | IMAGE |
| `blue` | The blue channel, as a three-channel grayscale image. | IMAGE |
| `alpha` | Alpha as a mask, inverted the same way as Load Image, so 1 marks fully transparent pixels. An image without an alpha channel returns an all-zero mask. | MASK |
