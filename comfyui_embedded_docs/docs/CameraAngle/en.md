# Compose Camera Angle Prompt

This node picks a camera angle around a subject and turns that choice into two things: a `camera_info` structure that 3D nodes can render, and a plain-English shot description you can paste into a prompt. The subject sits at the origin of the scene, where downstream 3D nodes centre their models, so the angle you pick here matches the preview.

Use it to frame a render before generating, or to describe a viewpoint such as `front view eye-level shot medium shot` for an image or video model. The 3D preview in the node shows the resulting camera position.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Description | Data Type | Required | Range |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| `horizontal_angle` | Azimuth around the subject in degrees: 0 is the front, 90 the right side, and 180 the back. (default: 0) | INT | Yes | 0 to 360 |
| `vertical_angle` | Elevation in degrees. Negative values look up from below, positive values look down from above. (default: 0) | INT | Yes | -30 to 60 |
| `zoom` | Lens zoom on the subject: 0 is a wide shot, 10 a close-up. The value is also carried into `camera_info.zoom`. (default: 5.0) | FLOAT | Yes | 0.0 to 10.0 (step 0.1) |
| `image` | Optional reference image, shown on the front of the subject cube in the 3D preview. | IMAGE | No | - |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Description | Data Type |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| `camera_info` | Camera information for 3D nodes: position, look-at target, zoom factor, camera type, and field of view. The camera keeps a fixed 35 degree field of view and is placed 6 units from the target. | LOAD3DCAMERA |
| `prompt` | Short shot description built from the angle, the elevation, and the distance, for example `front view eye-level shot medium shot`. | STRING |

## Shot Description Terms

The `prompt` output combines one term from each group below. Values are clamped to the widget ranges first.

- Horizontal angle is split into eight 45 degree sectors: `front view`, `front-right quarter view`, `right side view`, `back-right quarter view`, `back view`, `back-left quarter view`, `left side view`, `front-left quarter view`.
- Vertical angle becomes `low-angle shot` below -15 degrees, `eye-level shot` below 15, `elevated shot` below 45, and `high-angle shot` from 45 degrees up.
- Zoom becomes `wide shot` below 2, `medium shot` below 6, and `close-up` at 6 or more.

The `camera_info.zoom` factor scales the widget value onto 1.0 to 1.875, so zoom 0 gives 1.0 and zoom 10 gives 1.875.
