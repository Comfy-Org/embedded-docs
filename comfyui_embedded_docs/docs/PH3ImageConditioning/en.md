# p-h3-image Conditioning

This node turns a prompt into conditioning and an empty latent for a single still image with p-h3-image. Without images it is text to image; with images connected, `image_1` is the image being edited and the other slots act as references, which the prompt addresses as `<Picture 1>`, `<Picture 2>`, and so on. The sampler needs a model patched by the MiniMax H3 sigma shift node with both shift values at 1.0.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Description | Data Type | Required | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `clip` | The p-h3-image CLIP model used to tokenize the prompt, including any reference images, and to encode the conditioning. | CLIP | Yes | - |
| `prompt` | What to generate, or how to edit `image_1`. With images connected, a short instruction gets `Edit <Picture 1>. ` prepended. An instruction that already starts with `Edit <Picture` or an edit brief produced by a prompt upsampler is used exactly as written. | STRING | Yes | - |
| `width` | Output width in pixels. 0 uses the width of `image_1` after scaling, or 2912 when no image is connected (default: 0). | INT | Yes | 0 to MAX_RESOLUTION |
| `height` | Output height in pixels. 0 uses the height of `image_1` after scaling, or 2912 when no image is connected (default: 0). | INT | Yes | 0 to MAX_RESOLUTION |
| `vae` | The p-h3-image VAE. With it the pictures are also anchored as reference latents; without it they only condition the text encoder. | VAE | No | - |
| `images` | Growable group of up to 9 images, `image_1` through `image_9`. `image_1` is the image being edited, the remaining slots are references. | AUTOGROW | No | 0 to 9 images |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Description | Data Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `positive` | Conditioning for the p-h3-image sampler. When images are connected it also carries the packed reference latents. | CONDITIONING |
| `latent` | Empty latent for one still frame, including the two audio latents the model expects. | LATENT |

**Note:** With images connected and no `vae`, the pictures still guide the prompt through the text encoder but are not anchored as reference latents.

**Note:** The conditioning covers a single frame. For video or audio, use the MiniMax H3 video nodes instead.
