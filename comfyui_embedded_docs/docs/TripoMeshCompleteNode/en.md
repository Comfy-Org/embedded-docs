# Tripo: Complete Mesh Parts

Completes the parts of a segmented 3D model and repairs missing or damaged regions of the mesh. It takes the task ID of a Tripo mesh segmentation result, requests the completion job from Tripo, and waits for it to finish. You can optionally limit the work to specific part names. The completed model is returned as a GLB file.

<Note>
Tripo keeps task records on its servers for 7 days (effective December 1, 2026). A task ID older than that can no longer be resolved, so rerunning a saved workflow after the window fails at this node. To continue, run the earlier Tripo node again to create a fresh task ID, or re-import the model you already downloaded with **Tripo: Import Model**.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Description | Data Type | Required | Range |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| `segment_task_id` | Task ID of a Tripo mesh segmentation task. The parts of the segmented model from this task are completed. Connect the SEGMENT_TASK_ID output of a previous Tripo mesh segmentation node. | SEGMENT_TASK_ID | Yes | Single task ID |
| `part_names` | Comma-separated part names to complete. Empty completes every part. Default: empty string. Extra spaces around names are removed and duplicate names are ignored. | STRING | No | Free text or empty |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Description | Data Type |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| `model_file` | File name of the completed model. This output exists for backward compatibility only. | STRING |
| `model task_id` | Task ID of the completed Tripo mesh completion task. Can be used as input by other Tripo nodes that expect a model task ID. | MODEL_TASK_ID |
| `GLB` | The completed 3D model with repaired parts, downloaded as a GLB file. | GLB |
