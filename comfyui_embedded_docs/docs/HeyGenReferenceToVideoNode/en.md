# HeyGen Video 1.0 Reference to Video

Generate a video with synchronized dialogue and sound from a text prompt using HeyGen Video 1.0, optionally guided by connected reference material. Images of people, products or places, videos to reuse and audio clips that provide a voice can all be used as references. Mention each reference in the prompt as @Image1, @Video1 or @Audio1, numbered per type in the order the inputs are connected: these tags are rewritten into the labels HeyGen expects, and a tag that points to a reference which is not connected raises an error. Without any reference image or video the node runs as text-to-video generation.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Description | Data Type | Required | Range |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| `model` | Model version used for generation. (default: `"heygen-video-1"`) | DYNAMIC_COMBO | Yes | `"heygen-video-1"` |
| `prompt` | Description of the video, including any dialogue. Refer to connected references as @Image1, @Video1, @Audio1, numbered per type in input order. (default: empty string) | STRING | Yes | 1 to 16000 characters |
| `duration` | Duration of the output video in seconds. More than 15 seconds is available only without reference images and videos. (default: 5) | INT | Yes | 5 to 30 |
| `resolution` | Output resolution. 1080p and 2k require the 16:9 or 9:16 aspect ratio; 'auto' works at these resolutions only without references. (default: `"768p"`) | COMBO | Yes | `"768p"`<br>`"480p"`<br>`"1080p"`<br>`"2k"` |
| `aspect_ratio` | Output aspect ratio. `"auto"` is 16:9 when no references are connected, otherwise it follows the first reference image, or the first reference video when no images are connected. (default: `"auto"`) | COMBO | Yes | `"auto"`<br>`"16:9"`<br>`"9:16"`<br>`"1:1"`<br>`"4:3"`<br>`"3:4"`<br>`"21:9"` |
| `seed` | Seed for the generation. Results can still vary between runs with the same seed. (default: 42) | INT | Yes | 0 to 4294967295 |
| `reference_images` | Growable slot: images of people, products or places to use in the video (`image_1` ... `image_9`); refer to them as @Image1, @Image2, ... Each input must contain exactly one image, and each image must have an aspect ratio between 1:4 and 4:1. | IMAGE | No | 0 to 9 images |
| `reference_videos` | Growable slot: videos to use as references (`video_1` ... `video_3`); refer to them as @Video1, @Video2, ... At most 15 seconds of footage is used in total. | VIDEO | No | 0 to 3 videos |
| `reference_audios` | Growable slot: audio clips such as a voice for a speaker (`audio_1` ... `audio_3`); refer to them as @Audio1, @Audio2, ... Requires at least one reference image or video. A voice reference needs a few seconds of clean speech, and clips shorter than about 2 seconds are usually ignored. | AUDIO | No | 0 to 3 audio clips |
| `auto_duration` | When enabled, the video length follows the quoted dialogue in the prompt (8 to 30 seconds, or 8 to 15 with reference images or videos) and `duration` is ignored. (default: `"disabled"`) | COMBO | No | `"disabled"`<br>`"enabled"` |

### Parameter Constraints

- **Reference limit:** at most 15 references in total: up to 9 images, 3 videos and 3 audio clips. Connecting more raises an error.
- **Audio needs image or video:** reference audio is rejected when no reference image and no reference video is connected.
- **Reference image rules:** each `reference_images` input must hold exactly one image (a batch is rejected), and each image must be between 1:4 and 4:1 in aspect ratio.
- **Prompt tags:** `@ImageN`, `@VideoN` and `@AudioN` are matched case-insensitively. The number must not exceed the count of connected references of that type, and the prompt must be non-empty after trimming whitespace.
- **Mode:** with at least one reference image or video the request is a reference-to-video run; with none it is a plain text-to-video run.
- **1080p and 2k resolution:** `resolution` `"1080p"` or `"2k"` requires `aspect_ratio` `"16:9"` or `"9:16"`; `"auto"` is accepted at these resolutions only when no reference image and no reference video are connected.
- **Duration:** above 15 seconds is available only without reference images or videos, unless `auto_duration` is `"enabled"`.
- **Seed:** the seed only decides whether the node re-runs; results are not reproducible with the same seed.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Description | Data Type |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| `VIDEO` | The generated video with synchronized dialogue and sound. | VIDEO |
