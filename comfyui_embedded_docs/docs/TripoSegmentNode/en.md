# Tripo: Segment Model

This node splits a 3D model into individual parts. It sends the model to the Tripo segmentation service, waits for the job to finish, and returns the segmented model in GLB format along with a comma-separated list of part names. These part names feed downstream steps such as Tripo: Complete Mesh Parts, Tripo: Retopology and Tripo: Convert model.

<Note>
Tripo keeps task records on its servers for 7 days (effective December 1, 2026). A task ID older than that can no longer be resolved, so rerunning a saved workflow after the window fails at this node. To continue, run the earlier Tripo node again to create a fresh task ID, or re-import the model you already downloaded with **Tripo: Import Model**.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Description | Data Type | Required | Range |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| `model_task_id` | The task ID of the 3D model to be segmented into parts. | MODEL_TASK_ID | Yes | N/A |

## Outputs
