# HeyGen Video 1.0 Image to Video

Animate an image into a video with synchronized dialogue and sound using HeyGen Video 1.0. The connected image is used as the first frame, and the generated video keeps its aspect ratio. Describe what should happen, including any spoken lines, in the prompt. The node uploads the image, creates the video job, waits for it to finish and returns the resulting video.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Description | Data Type | Required | Range |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| `model` | Model version used for generation. (default: `"heygen-video-1"`) | DYNAMIC_COMBO | Yes | `"heygen-video-1"` |
| `image` | First frame of the video. Exactly one image is required; a batch is rejected. Crop the image to change the shape of the video, because the output keeps this image's aspect ratio. | IMAGE | Yes | 1 image, aspect ratio 1:4 to 4:1 |
| `prompt` | Description of what happens in the video, including any dialogue. (default: empty string) | STRING | Yes | 1 to 16000 characters |
| `duration` | Duration of the output video in seconds. Ignored when `auto_duration` is `"enabled"`. (default: 5) | INT | Yes | 5 to 30 |
| `resolution` | Output resolution. 1080p and 2k render only at 16:9 or 9:16, so the image needs that shape; crop it first. (default: `"768p"`) | COMBO | Yes | `"768p"`<br>`"480p"`<br>`"1080p"`<br>`"2k"` |
| `seed` | Seed for the generation. Results can still vary between runs with the same seed. (default: 42) | INT | Yes | 0 to 4294967295 |
| `auto_duration` | When enabled, the video length follows the quoted dialogue in the prompt (8 to 30 seconds) and `duration` is ignored. (default: `"disabled"`) | COMBO | No | `"disabled"`<br>`"enabled"` |

### Parameter Constraints

- **Single image:** `image` must contain exactly one image. Connecting a batch raises an error.
- **Image aspect ratio:** the image must be no wider than 4x its height and no taller than 4x its width (between 1:4 and 4:1); otherwise the run fails.
- **Prompt required:** the prompt must contain at least one non-whitespace character and at most 16000 characters.
- **High resolutions:** `resolution` `"1080p"` and `"2k"` need a 16:9 or 9:16 image, because the video keeps the image's aspect ratio. Crop the image for other shapes.
- **Seed:** the seed only decides whether the node re-runs; results are not reproducible with the same seed.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Description | Data Type |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| `VIDEO` | The generated video with synchronized dialogue and sound, at the aspect ratio of the input image. | VIDEO |
